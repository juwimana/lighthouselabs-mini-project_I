# Lighthouse Labs Mini Project I

Welcome to my first **Lighthouse LabsMini Project**!! 

## Transport of London

During this mini-project, I will be working with the API from [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The motivation of this project is to practice different HTTP requests and extracting values from complex lists and nested dictionaries, and deploying project on streamlit.
