### Motivation
* Learn how to work with `API Documentation` (in this case, [Transport of London Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/))
* Practice handling of `complex list and dictionaries in Python`

### Note:
* `Each task` is explicitly defined by the header of each expander
* In each expander are the `results` and important details (for example, API Functions used)
